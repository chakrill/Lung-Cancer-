Creating a GitHub README for a Lung Cancer Prediction project involves providing concise and informative content that encourages users to understand, contribute, and use the project effectively. Below is a sample README template for a Lung Cancer Prediction project:

Lung Cancer Prediction



Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting lung cancer based on relevant medical data. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases of lung cancer early, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess medical data for training and evaluation.
Model Training: Utilize state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for training a lung cancer prediction model.
Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Web Application (Optional): Deploy a web-based interface for easy interaction with the trained mode
