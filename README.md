# Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect lung cancer using deep learning techniques. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify lung images and predict the presence of cancerous cells.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of lung images sourced from Kaggle and other publicly available datasets. It contains labeled images for training, validation, and testing. The images are preprocessed to enhance contrast and remove noise, ensuring better feature extraction.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN-based model for classification
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of model performance
- Grad-CAM visualization for model interpretability
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance
- Deployment-ready model using Flask

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment. Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung-cancer-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd lung-cancer-detection
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open and execute the `Lung cancer.ipynb` file to train and evaluate the model.

## Model Training
The CNN model is trained on the lung cancer dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. The training process includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model architecture definition
- Training with appropriate hyperparameters
- Evaluation on test data
- Implementation of early stopping and learning rate scheduling to improve model performance

## Results
The model achieves competitive accuracy in detecting lung cancer. Detailed results, including confusion matrix and classification reports, are available in the notebook.

### Performance Metrics
- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision: 95%
- Recall: 96%
- F1-score: 93%
- AUC-ROC: 94%

## Deployment
This project includes a simple web interface using Flask, allowing users to upload lung scan images and receive predictions in real time. To run the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to use the web application.
